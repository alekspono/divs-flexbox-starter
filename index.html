    <h1>Hi, I'm Alex.</h1>
    <h3>I’m a <span>Responsive Designer and Developer</span>. My passion is to realize web-developing dreams and bring them to visual
        fruition in the digital world. My other passions include listening to opera, wandering through museums, and learning as many languages as my mind can contain.</h3>
        <div class="div-1" class="flex-items">
            <p><span>Classical music</span> has always been a part of my life – I don't remember a time when I didn't know how to play violin. But as a child the one type of classical music I could not, would
                not like, was opera. Then, one fortuitous day in college I saw a performance of “The Marriage of Figaro”, in an
                elective course and I was hooked.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-2" class="flex-items">
            <p>I love looking at <span>art</span>. It is akin to therapy for me. One of my favorite artists is Wassily Kandinski.
                Though I do not claim to understand the true depth of his work, it brings me so much joy to look at
                the colors, lines and motion in his work. Though, admittedly, my own artistic talents extend to coloring
                books and squiggly doodles. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-3" class="flex-items">
            <p>Learning languages is a hobby/necessity for me. It stems from being an <span>immigrant</span>, and having had to
                immerse myself into a completely new language culture as a child. I now often crave this, and have been
                able to realize it primarily through travel and the chance to practice both in and outside of the
                classroom.
