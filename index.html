            <p>Regarding Opera: Classical music has always been a part of my life – having been raised as a
                non-professional but active violinist. But as a child the one type of classical music I could not, would
                not like, was opera. Then, as often happens, in college I took an
                elective about the music of Mozart, and once I saw a performance of “The Marriage of Figaro”,
                I was hooked.

            <p>I love looking at art. It is akin to therapy for me. One of my favorite artists is Wassily Kandinski.
                Though I do not claim to understand the true depth of his work, it brings me so much peace to look at
                the colors, lines and motion in his work. </p>

            <p>Learning languages is a hobby/necessity for me. It stems from being an immigrant, and having had to
                immerse myself into a completely new language culture as a child. I now often crave this, and have been
                able to realize it primarily through travel and the chance to practice both in and outside of the
                classroom.
